Some options can cause you to be skeptical such as a Moneygram or a Western Union cash transfer. The reason for such skepticism is due to the many scams involving money transfers that exist today. If you are planning to play on various online betting sites, it is important to secure your withdrawals and deposits through a safe platform. One of the most continuously trending platforms to safely transfer money online to betting sites is through PayPal.The company is known throughout the world for consecutive years of secure business. Companies such as online betting sites almost always accept PayPal. Before getting started, you should get a little more familiar with PayPal and how the system works. This article will dig into the history of PayPal as well as helpful information such as funding your account, withdrawing, and conducting safe transfers. Additionally, youâll get answers to a plethora of questions most commonly asked by the consensus of PayPal users that are relevant to online betting. Here is our Top 7 List for PayPal Betting Sites:UK/International Betting Sites that Accept PayPal (Non US Players)Betting Site Betting Bonus Get BonusBet Â£10 & get Â£30 freebet + Â£10 CASINO Bonus Visitbet Â£10, get Â£30 free Visit100% up to Â£50 freebet VisitAustralian Betting Sites that Accept PayPal (Non US Players)Betting Site Betting Bonus Get BonusDeposit A$50 Claim A$150 in bonus bets Visitdeposit A$20, play with A$100 Visit100% up to A$200 VisitDaily Fantasy Sports that Accept Paypal (US Players)Daily Fantasy Site Bonus DETAILS Get BonusFree Entry 5 Free NFL Entries Min Deposit $10 Max Deposit $10,000 Withdrawal 24-48 hours VisitFree Entry On First Deposit Min Deposit $10 Max Deposit $2,000 Withdrawal 24-48 hours VisitPaypal History: How it Revolutionized the Online MarketPayPal initially became the first internet wallet platform on the market in 1998. The design team, whom all attended the University of Illinois, first targeted hand-held palm pilots and PDAs to create the first ever âeWallet.â In 2000, the company joined world renowned Elon Musk and his X.com online banking company. The two were able to make money transfers available through handheld devices while avoiding any fraudulent activity by using new and improving data encryption. Online gambling in the United States and other auctioning sites like Ebay took over the web due to easy payment processing through PayPal. Electronically transferring money had never been done so efficiently.Although online gambling transactions that occurred from 2002 to 2004 via PayPal were later seen as illicit, the total amount of transactions still only accounted for 8 percent of PayPalâs total business. The payment processing platform was still operating solely in the United States and Canada, but soon was overflowing into international markets.The Ebay Merge and SplitIn 2002, eBay, an item auctioning site that essentially cuts out the middleman, purchased PayPal just after the payment processing site went public. After the merger to unite PayPal and Ebay, the payment processing site began to stop financial transactions regarding illegal gambling overseas. Although the site and new parent company, eBay were later left with a government fine of $10 million, the cessation of transactions saved the future of the enterprise.Similar platforms began taking over the array of US online gambling customers. However, from 2006 forward, the companies were persecuted and massively hindered by the law. The series of civil lawsuits that followed made sure that payment processing companies paid back all illicit profits with additional fines and restrictions. Ebay and PayPal would later split in 2015 back into separate companies.Paypal's Revival of Online BettingBy 2009, PayPal was available in countries all around the world, including most major European nations. Through legal advice and reconciliation with international jurisdictions, PayPal once again started to process payments for online gambling sites. The second go ahead though came with the dealing of businesses that fully operated within the confines of their territoryâs respective gambling laws. The start of PayPal online betting expansion came in the United Kingdom through the popular betting site, BetFair, which only dealt with UK residents. The next to follow in the footsteps of the BetFair Exchange platform were authorized sportsbooks. This included a number of companies such as LadBrokes, 888, and Bet365. PayPal was not quick to accept the businesses without a full acquiring of proof of legality surrounding the operations.The sites known as Bet365 and Ladbrokes are now presently operating as some of the largest betting companies to service Europe. In addition, PayPal has recently begun doing business with Casino companies such as Caesars Entertainment, Wynn Casinos, and World Series of Poker. The site is now authorizing payments for such businesses in the state of Delaware, Nevada, and New Jersey.PayPal and US Skill Game Payment ProcessingWith the 2006 Unlawful Internet Gambling Enforcement Act outlawing nearly every form of online gambling, skill games began their boom on the online market. The UIGEA allows states to decide what is constituted as a game of skill and what is a game of chance. Due to state legislature taking precedence over federal, states such as Nevada and New Jersey allow online gambling as long as it operates and is regulated by those states. A number of states are in constant legal battles to push either for or against other possible online gambling options.PayPal has now extended its grasp to process payments for licensed skill game platforms. Although skill games can resemble casino-style gambling, the basis and outcome of the game are up to the knowledge and mastery of the player. Popular skill game sites that have linked up with PayPal are GSNâs WorldWinner and King Games.Of Course, Daily Fantasy Sports would be at the top of the list for PayPalâs interests. The payment processing company has partnered with the industryâs largest platforms, DraftKings, and FanDuel. Both companies are ironically in hot water with legal trouble in a handful of states but remain âa game of skillâ federally. PayPalâs future will be hindered if DFS sites close shop in the United States, as the fantasy sports betting industry has boosted PayPalâs business tremendously.Popular PayPal Online Betting QuestionsHow Do I Withdraw my PayPal Balance?PayPal has a multitude of options when it comes to making a withdrawal. If you link a bank account directly to your PayPal, you can request a withdrawal which usually transfers within 48 hours. PayPal can also send out a PayPal Debit Card to you that is acceptable at all retailers and ATMs. Lastly, you also have the option to choose to receive either a paper check in the mail or an electronic check online.Am I Safe Using a PayPal Account for Online Betting Sites?PayPal uses a 128-bit encryption similar to banking security, providing another line of financial defense for all players. Using PayPal for online betting sites is far safer than directly linking your bank account or credit card. Such as any online money transfer systems, it is always important to monitor your transactions and report any activity that is unknown to the account holder.Why Does My Betting Site Does Not Show a PayPal Withdrawal Option?If the site you are playing on is located overseas, there is a chance they do not accept PayPal. However, for sites that do accept PayPal, the withdraw option will not show up as available until a PayPal deposit is successfully transferred to the betting site.Can I Use Another Personâs PayPal Account to make a Betting Site Deposit?Only the person with the name on the PayPal account can legally make deposits to online betting sites. The same is said for withdrawals. Families are encouraged to each make personal accounts to avoid service refusal at online gambling sites.Does PayPal Charge Me Anything to Deposit/Withdraw?No online betting sites will never charge you a fee for linking your PayPal account. When depositing money through your bank or debit card, there is no fee. However, there is a 2.9 percent charge to deposits done with a credit card. You can withdraw your PayPal balance to a connected bank account free of charge, and at any time. It is important to check for withdrawing details for any online site you are willing to try, for some do require a fee to withdraw money using any method.Do I Need a PayPal Account to Use PayPal?You can not transfer, deposit, or withdraw any money through PayPal without signing up first. Fortunately, creating an account is easy and fast with step by step help to speed up the process.Why canât U.S. players deposit at a betting site using PayPal?At the moment, online betting sites such as sportsbooks, poker rooms, and online casinos are illegal in the United States. The two excluded states of Nevada and New Jersey have fully regulated, licensed, and are managing online betting operations so residents can still fully gamble online. PayPal however, will not operate or process payments for residents of the United States for illegal gambling. Offshore sites will usually be easily identifiable by not offering PayPal as a legal payment method. In addition to the 2006 Unlawful Internet Gambling Enforcement Act of deeming all online gambling illegal in the US, it also put an immediate halt and backlash on payment processing platforms.Where Can I Use PayPal?Person to Person payment processing is available in over 100 countries. Betting sites all over the globe use PayPal as well, but PayPal only accepts transactions from legal and licensed companies. Within the United States, the only two states that permit funding an online betting account through PayPal are Nevada and New Jersey. These two states have legalized a series of online betting platforms and offer PayPal as a primary method for payment processing.Daily Fantasy Sports and PayPalPayPal does offer payment processing for skill game sites such as FanDuel and DraftKings. The reason DFS sites are allowed to use PayPal is that the UIGEA did not outlaw fantasy sports betting after banning nearly every other gambling option. United States Congress dissected the game to see if chance was a large impact, and after deliberation, the consensus is that many skill based variables control the overall outcome of the game. As of late, several states are opposing this federal law and further investigating the elements of chance in DFS. For now, US residents in DFS allowable states are welcome to use PayPal as one of the quickest ways for money transferring.Pros and Cons of PayPalWith PayPal, you can instantly fund an account through an immediate deposit. Some other online wallet platforms take a long time and even take fees on deposits. Many businesses will offer to deposit your paycheck to a PayPal balance.A major drawback for PayPal is the 2.9 percent charge on credit card deposits. The fee is small compared to the positives of PayPal, but on a larger deposit, the percentage fee adds up. Additionally, the withdrawal process can take up to 48hrs to successfully go through to a bank account.Which Betting Sites Accept PayPal?Bet365888 SportCoralLadbrokesBetVictor10BetBetwayBetwayWinnerWilliam HillTitanbetBetfredNetBetUnibetBetfairPaddy Powerand more!Can You Use PayPal on bet365?Yes, you can indeed use PayPal on bet365.

      "174249-D399803\tdoes xpress bet charge to deposit money in your account\thttp://vegasclick.com/online/legal Is online gambling legal in the U.S.? \"We answer the question:Is online gambling legal in the U.S.?by Michael Bluejay,  Last Updated:  March 2018 I'm not a lawyer. Do not  rely on this article as legal advice. I also can't  guarantee to have heard of every relevant case.Short answer: Not illegal under federal law, possibly  illegal under state law, but even there prosecution is rare.There is no U.S. federal law against gambling onlineThere is no U.S. federal law  against gambling online. At the federal level,  gambling online is perfectly legal, because of the lack of a law  against it. It's possible to run afoul of state law (especially in extremely conservative states), but even there  prosecution is extremely rare. This article focuses mostly on  federal law.U.S. Attorney Catherine Hanaway admitted in a House  hearing that just placing wagers online doesn't violate  federal law. No American has ever been arrested,  indicted, or prosecuted by the feds for gambling online, because  there's no law against it. If online gambling were  illegal I wouldn't be running his website for fifteen years, as an  American citizen, living in the U.S., using my real name. And  I occasionally gamble online, too, and I admit that publicly, like  I'm doing right now.This might be confusing because  other outlets erroneously reported that Congress banned online  gambling in 2006. Those reports are simply  wrong. The 2006 law makes it illegal for banks to move  gambling money when the bets are already illegal (like  from a state law), but doesn't make it illegal for players to  make bets . The law simply does not create or extend any  ban on gambling itself. In fact, the law says quite clearly,  \"\"No provision of this subchapter shall be construed as altering,  limiting, or extending any Federal or State law or Tribal-State  compact prohibiting, permitting, or regulating gambling within the  United States.\"\" If you want to check for yourself, here's the full  text of the law.Sports bettingIt is against  federal law for websites to take sports bets over the Internet.  (It's against federal law for a  site to take the bets, not for you to place them.) Federal law  doesn't specifically allow or prohibit sites from taking casino or  poker bets, just sports bets. For many years the Dept. of  Justice interpreted the Wire Act to prohibit sites from  taking casino/poker bets too, but most legal observers disagreed,  and in Dec. 2011 the DoJ finally agreed that the Wire Act doesn't  prohibit sites from taking casino/poker bets.  ( Forbes)AdvertisingPublishing advertisements for  online gambling isn't specifically illegal, and it would be quite  a stretch to make a case under a different statute (like  racketeering or conspiracy). Small publishers (like  me) have never faced fed action running ads for online  gambling. The only publishers to face penalties were some huge  publishers (Google, Yahoo, and Microsoft, in 2007), and a mid-size  publisher in 2006 (The Sporting News). I wish they had  contested the charges, since legal observers say they weren't  breaking any law, but each simply paid a fine to end the matter  quickly. None ever faced any criminal charges. The Sporting  News' fine was equal to the money they'd collected from gambling  ads. Google's penalty was less than half a single day's profit for  them.  ( Point-Spreads.com) Other publishers who took ads (like Esquire, who ran Bodog's poker  ads) were warned by the DoJ not to take them any more, stopped doing  so, and faced no penalties.State lawsSome states might have  laws against online gambling, but even there prosecution against  players is rare. I know of only two cases a player ran  afoul of state laws (in extremely conservative states), both of whom  were charged under their state's general anti-gambling  laws, not any specific anti- online -gambling law. The  first was Jeffrey Trauman of North  Dakota, who in 2003 paid a $500 fine on what was probably  over $100,000 in online sports bet winnings.  ( Gambling  & the Law ) The other  was online sports bettor Roland Benavides of Oklahoma ,  who was charged in 2011 and in 2012 received a deferred sentence  (which means that if he doesn't violate the terms of his probation,  he will likely face no jail time).  ( News  OK ) Some states have gone the other way and  legalized online gambling in at least some form. (See the  bottom of this page.)RiskRather than just considering the  law, it's more useful to look at the potential  risk of each activity. That  is, which activities are more likely to result in a fine or maybe  even jail time? Below is my take on how things stack up, from  most risky to least risky. But first, some  important caveats:I'll consider only federal law, not individual state laws.The law and the enforcement are constantly changing, and what's  true today could be different tomorrow.I don't guarantee to have heard of every relevant case.I'm a layperson, not a lawyer, and god help you if you rely on  this article instead of seeking appropriate legal counsel for your  situation.With that in mind, here's my analysis of  risk:Risk Activity Examples of  fed action5Taking sports bets on a server  located in the U.S.Taking  sports bets on a U.S. server is the most clearly illegal  activity, and as a result, probably no one has ever risked  trying it.Taking  sports bets over U.S. phone lines. BetOnSports  (2006, prison); Bodog (2012, pending)Taking sports bets on a foreign server. Bodog  (2012) Sportingbet (2006)  World Sports Exchange (2000; prison)  ( details on  above cases)Facilitating the transfer of funds to online casinos  (payment processors), and then visiting the U.S. Processors serving  FullTilt, PokerStars, Absolute Poker, & UltimateBet  (2011)  eWalletXpress (2010)  Douglas Rennick of Canada (2010)  Ahmad Khawaja and Allied Wallet (2009)  Neteller (2007)  ( details  on above cases)Accepting advertising for  Internet gambling, in the major media  Google, Yahoo, Microsoft,  The Sporting News (2003)  Esquire (2005)  ( more  on these cases)4Helping people make bets on a websiteInternationalNetCasino (2004)  (action  by the State of New Jersey, not the feds; more)3Taking casino/poker bets  on a foreign server In December 2011, after  they prosecuted the cases below, the feds finally agreed  that poker bets aren't covered by the Wire Act.  FullTilt Poker,  PokerStars, Absolute Poker  (2011)  Party Gaming (2008)Accepting advertising for Internet gambling, smaller  mediaIntegrityCasinoGuide.com  (2006)  (state of WA shut it down, not  the feds; more)2Buying advertising in a U.S. publication as a casino,  poker room, or affiliateNo legal troubles that we know of for this  activity.1Placing bets yourself on the InternetNo trouble with the feds that we know of. A  handful of states have anti-online-gambling raws,  but even there prosecution is rare. (See the intro  to this article.)Taking bets on a server located in the U.S.  (Risk  Level: 5)Taking bets (i.e., operating a casino, sportsbook, or racebook) on  a website located in the U.S. is assumed to be illegal, and nobody  does this in the U.S. for that reason. All Internet gaming websites  are located in other countries where it's legal for them to operate.  (The U.S. government maintains that it's not legal for them to serve  U.S. players.)Taking sports bets over U.S. phone  lines.  (Risk Level: 5)Taking sporting bets over the phone lines is clearly illegal thanks  to the Wire Act.BetOnSports took bets over the phone, and were blatant about  it, buying big billboards in the U.S. advertising their phone  number. They were also really big potatoes, taking in $4.6 billion  wagers from 2001 to 2005. In July 2006, their then-CEO, David  Carruthers, was arrested while changing planes in Texas on the way  to Costa Rica from the U.K. In April 2009 he pleaded guilty to  federal racketeering charges, and in January 2010 was sentenced to  33 months in prison. The company's founder, Gary Kaplan, was  arrested in the Puerto Rico in March 2007 and in November 2009 was  sentenced to four years in prison and ordered to forfeit $44 million  in revenue. (He was reportedly released in Oct. 2011, according to Gambling911 .) Kaplan's brother and sister pleaded guilty in June 2009 to two  felony conspiracy charges and agreed to turn over more than $6  million held in Swiss bank accounts. They were also sentenced to 10  months of house arrest. In December 2009, the company itself was  fined $28.2 million.  ( GPWA , USA  Today, The  Register)Taking sports bets on  foreign server.  (Risk Level: 5)Most observers agree that the Wire Act applies to online sports  betting. The feds sure think so.Bodog (2012). In February 2012, the feds indicted  Calvin Ayre, founder of Bodog, along with three other  Canadians, James Philip, David Ferguson and Derrick Maloney. Ayre et al were charged with running an online sports gambling  business, and money laundering. The former carries a possible  sentence of five years. The feds also seized the Bodog.com domain,  which didn't matter much, since Bodog had been smart enough to move  its business to other domains (like Bodog.eu) months before the  feds' seizure.  ( Forbes ,  2012) UPDATE 2017: Ayre plead guilty to a mere  misdemeanor and the feds dropped the felony charges. He never  spent a night in jail.  ( Gaming  Today)Small operators (2011). In May 2011, the feds issued  indictments against some small companies taking sports bets  online. It also seized their domain names.  ( Casino  City)Sportingbet (2006). While federal law is murky, some new  state laws are not. In September 2006, the chairman of London-based  Sportingbet was arrested in New York by the request of Louisana  authorities for violating Louisiana's ban on Internet gambling. One  wonders why Peter Dicks thought it would be a good idea for a  chairman of a UK-based Internet gambling operation to visit the U.S.  right after the CEO of another UK-based Internet gambling operation  just got arrested after visiting the U.S. (David Carruthers of  BetOnSports, above). Perhaps he thought he'd be safe because unlike  BetOnSports, Sportingbet wasn't pushing the envelope on phone-based  bets. He also probably had no idea that an individual U.S. state  would consider his company to be breaking the law and would have him  arrested over it.  ( iGamingNews)World Sports Exchange (2000). American Jay Cohen located  his sportsbook offshore in Antigua, but when he returned to the U.S.  but when he returned to the U.S. he was arrested, and in 2000 he was  convicted, fined $5000, and sentenced to 21 months in prison, of  which he served 17.  ( NY  Times, Gambling  911) In January 2016, his business partner,  Haden Ware, returned to the U.S. from Antigua to surrender (he'd  been a fugitive since 2002), pleaded guilty, and was sentenced to  only six months probation.  ( AP , SBR)Facilitating the transfer of funds  to online gambling operators (payment processing) whether in the  U.S. or not.  (Risk Level: 5)Gamblers used to get money in and out of casinos with a  service called Neteller, which is kind of like PayPal. But in January 2007 the founders of Neteller were arrested in the  U.S. and charged with money laundering.  ( Creator.com ) A few days later Neteller stopped serving U.S. customers.  ( iGamingNews , GPWA) Neteller eventually  paid a big fine and agreed to stop serving U.S. customers. (As  a result, it's now harder for players to get money into or out of an  online casino; here's our article that explains how  to make deposits and withdrawals .) Some processors handle only payments to players from the casinos  (sending checks to the players), not helping players get money into the casino. These haven't been safe either:In January 2011 the feds seized nearly $8  million from processors serving PokerStars, Full Tilt Poker,  Ultimate Bet and Absolute Poker.  ( Forbes) One processor, Ira Rubin, was sentenced to three years.  ( ESPN) Another, Bradley Franzen pleaded guilty in May 2011,  ( Forbes ) though as of Nov. 2015, I can't find any report of whether  he was actually sentenced. Absolute Poker co-founder Brent  Buckley was sentenced to 14 months for defrauding banks.  ( iGamingBusiness) The whole case is explained in detail on Wikipedia.Douglas Rennick who ran a Canadian-based processor was arrested  in 2010, forfeited $17 million, but didn't get  any jail time.  ( Bloomberg , Online-Casinos , Best  Poker Sites)In November 2010 feds seized money in accounts  belonging to payment processor eWalletXpress. The company  was forced out of the U.S. market.  ( Casino  City)Daniel Tzvetkoff (founder) and Andrew Thornhill of the payment  processor Intabill were charged with conspiracy, money laundering,  and bank fraud in 2010 . Thornhill pleaded  guilty in June and in October was sentenced to three months in  prison and fined $25,000.  ( Pepper  Hamilton LLP)The Feds seized $13 million from Ahmad Khawaja and Allied Wallet  in 2009.  ( Forbes)Some smaller actions in 2008-2011 are listed  at Pepper  Hamilton.Accepting advertising for Internet gambling,  in the major media  (Risk Level: 5)Google, Yahoo, Microsoft, The Sporting News (2003-2007).In 2003 the U.S. Dept. of Justice sent a letter ( PDF )  to the National Association of Broadcasters and to Google,  Yahoo, Microsoft, The Sporting News, warning them that accepting ads  for online gambling could be illegal. So they all stopped accepting  ads. In reality, it doesn't appear that taking ads for casino  & poker is illegal at all, since online casino & poker  themselves aren't illegal. Only the ads for online  sportsbetting would have been clearly illegal. But all those  warned stopped running the gambling ads anyway.The Sporting News (TSN) took its time in stopping the ads  (six months), which pissed off the government, which three years  later fined them $7.2 million, in January 2006. The settlement  represents TSN's profits on the ads for the three years it accepted  them (2000-2003), and was paid with $4.2 million in cash, and $3  million in public service ads in its own publications explaining how  online gambling is illegal.  (more from the Corporate  Crime Reporter)In December 2007 the three big Internet giants paid a fine for  accepting ads for online gaming. Google's fine was only about  a third of a single day's profit.  ( Point-Spreads.com)The three companies had actually ceased taking online gambling ads  about four years before the settlement, when they got the warning,  but the feds fined them anyway -- years later.Esquire, 2005. In April 2005 the feds subpoenaed Esquire  magazine for taking ads in its March issue for online poker operator  Bodog.The Dot-Net Workaround. Many online operators found a way  around ad restrictions years ago: They advertise the .net version of their website, which is a play-for-free space. Of course,  they're hoping that players will click from there over to the .com version and wager for real money, or that players will just type in .com out of habit.  ( NY  Post)Helping people make bets on a  website  (Risk Level: 4)The webmaster of the portal InternationalNetCasino.com was indicted  by New Jersey authorities in Nov. 2004 for facilitating gambling.  The affiliate apparently took money from would-be players directly  in order to help them place bets. It seems that if he had simply  advertised the gambling operations and not gotten directly involved  he probably would have been okay. Even so, his sentence was light:  the eight days he'd already served in jail, $1330 in fines, and 90  days of community service.  ( iGamingNews)Taking casino/poker bets online  (Risk  Level: 3)Offshore companies taking bets from Americans for poker and  casino games isn't against the law. In 2002 the U.S.  5th Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that the 1961 Wire Act applies  only to \"\"sporting events and contests\"\" and not gambling in general.  ( World  Law Direct) But that  didn't stop the feds from prosecuting offshore poker rooms anyway,  through 2011. Then in Dec. 2011, the feds finally agreed that  it's only sports bets that are illegal to accept online, not  casino/poker bets. That's got to be cold comfort to the poker  sites the feds busted earlier. But in any event, now that the  feds have supposedly come around, I'm downgrading the risk of taking  casino/poker bets online. Of course if there are more  prosecutions then I'm moving the risk right back up.Doyles Room (2011, poker). Feds seized the domain  DoylesRoom.com.  ( CasinoCity)FullTilt Poker,  PokerStars, Absolute Poker (2011, poker). Feds seized  the domain names of these three online poker sites on April 15,  2011, and charged 11 individuals with bank fraud, illegal gambling  and laundering billions of dollars.  ( PokerListings) But  this wasn't just about online gamblingFullTilt is alleged to have  not kept players' money in segregated accounts like they were  supposed to, and in fact its operators embezzled millions of dollars  in player funds, and thus was unable to repay players in full when  the government shut them down. Of course, this is why people  such as myself are saying that online gambling should be legalized  and regulated to protect the players.Another controversial aspect of this  case is that the feds seized the .com domain names of the poker  rooms in question, which they clearly had no right to do, since they  didn't have that kind of jurisdiction -- nobody does, since domain  names are international. As attorney Nelson Rose said, \"\"The  next to step through could be an Islamic country, which outlaws  alcohol, seizing the worldwide domain names of every retailer and  restaurant that advertises beer or wine.\"\"  ( Casino  City Times)Note that the feds didn't seize the  domains at the registrar level, they went straight to the .com  registry, which happens to be located in the U.S. So companies  who think they can shield themselves by registering their dot-coms  with foreign registrars are quite mistaken.In July 2012, Full Tilt CEO Ray  Bitar was arrested for the April 2011 indictment.  ( GPWA) He  faces the potential of life in prison. The same month, Brent  Beckley, an owner of Absolute Poker, got a 14-month sentence for  deceiving banks about the nature of his company's transactions.  ( Reuters)  (Note the technicality they got him on: Not charged with  running an online gambling site, but rather charged with misleading  banks about the transactions. It's the moving the money  through the banks that's illegal.)Party Gaming (2008, poker). In December 2008 Party  Gaming co-founder Anurang Dikshit pleaded guilty to violating the  1961 Wire Act with his poker site (even though the Wire Act doesn't  apply to poker) forfeited $300 million, and was sentenced to one  year of probation -- avoiding jail time. It's a sad world when  you're forced to plead guilty to breaking a law that doesn't exist.  ( Forbes) In April 2009, Party Gaming itself agreed to $105 million to avoid  prosecution.  ( GPWA)Accepting advertising for Internet  gambling, in the smaller media  (Risk Level: 3)It's only the major media players who have gotten heat  from the government for accepting gambling ads, and the only  penalty has been fines, not criminal charges. All of the minor media has been spared so far. Even Casino City, the largest website  on the Internet which carries online gambling ads, hasn't received a  cease and desist notice from the government.Of course, just because publishers haven't faced heat yet doesn't mean they never will. Publishers run the risk of  being charged wth three separate crimes.:Aiding & Abetting . In short, advertising  something that's illegal, is also illegal. Since online  casinos & poker aren't illegal there should be little problem,  but advertising online sports wagering could be a problem, because  sports betting violates the Wire Act. I don't run ads for  online sports on Vegas Click.Being in the Business of Gambling. Most small  publishers act as affiliates, getting a percentage of  player losses when they refer players to an online gambling  site. But the argument could be made that if you share in  the gambling profits directly, then you're \"\"in the business\"\" of  gambling, and could face the same charges that the gambling  operator itself faces. Here again, the gambling operation  itself would have to be illegal in order for a publisher to have  this liability. Casino and poker aren't specifically  illegal, though sports betting definitely is. One way around  the \"\"Being in the Business\"\" risk is to sell your adspace for a  flat monthly fee, rather than as an affiliate who gets a  percentage of sales. That's what I do, and what the Wizard  of Odds does, for that very reason. However, very small  publishers will often have a hard time getting gambling sites to  pay a monthly fee rather than on an affiliate basis. I don't  know how CPA (cost-per-acquisition) fits into this, where you get  paid for every new player you refer, regardless of how much they  win or lose, though I suspect the risk would be somewhere between  revenue-share affiliate and monthly-basis sales.Conspiracy. Conspiracy is two or more people  planning a crime. So basically, any time a crime is broken  and more than one party is involved, the feds can tack on a  conspiracy charge. As with the others, this requires that  some other law actually be broken first.Casino City case. In August 2004 Casino City sued the  DoJ to establish its right to accept ads for Internet gambling. A  judge dismissed the case, saying Casino City didn't have standing  because it hadn't received one of the cease & desist letters.  Casino City filed an appeal, but before it could be heard, Casino  City withdrew from the case in February 2006, apparently because  they felt that they'd made their point: If the government ever tells  Casino City that it can't accept gambling ads, Casino City will  fight.  ( Lawrence  Walters, Esq.)State Law. Even if one doesn't run afoul of the feds,  there's a chance that state government will come calling. In June  2006 the state of Washington advised the owner of the gambling  portal IntegrityCasinoGuide.com that advertising online gambling  violated Washington law. The site owner took the site down,  and it appears that he faced no penalty.  ( Poker  News)The Future. Again, I don't know of any small  publisher who's been hit for running ads, though I can't say that  will never happen. My guess is that small publishers would get  a warning letter first before any criminal indictments were  made. Probably the biggest risk is that the government might  seize the domain name, so that even if there were no criminal  charges, the publisher might be deprived of their livelihood.Buying advertising as a casino, poker room, or affiliate  (Risk  Level: 2)The only buyers of advertising who have been targeted have  been offshore sportsbooks. Casino and poker operators haven't  faced any action. While the DoJ waved a finger at Esquire for taking  Bodog's poker ads, their attention was directed at Esquire ,  not the operator, Bodog. Affiliates and portals have never received  attention from the government, so far as we know.Making bets on the internet (as a player)  (Risk  Level: 1)There's no federal law against playing the games  themselves, as a player. Even a U.S. Attorney admitted in 2007  that placing wagers online doesn't  violate federal law. As attorney Nelson Rose said, \"\"There is  no federal law against being merely a player. About half the states  do have ancient laws on the books that sometimes make it a crime to  make a bet. But you have a better chance of winning the World Poker  Tour than of being arrested.\"\"  ( Casino  City) So far as we know, no U.S. citizen has  ever faced federal charges for gambling online.Now, two players we know of were charged under their state laws. Jeffrey Trauman of North Dakota was charged in 2003 for  making sports bets online, but he likely attracted attention since  his winnings seemed to be over $100,000.  ( Gambling  & the Law) And Roland Benavides in Oklahoma  was charged, possibly attracting attention because he's also a  police officer.  ( Norman  Transcript) Oklahoma doesn't specifically  outlaw online gambling, but their draconian statutes outlaw just  about any kind of gambling whatsoever, so Benavides was  charged under the general gambling statute.  ( News  OK) In 2012 he received a deferred sentence, which  means that if he doesn't violate the terms of his probation, he'll  likely face no jail time.  ( News  OK)State LawsI don't have the resources to cover all the various State laws, but  here's a little bit anyway. Note that even in states which  have expressly legalized online gambling, they generally allow  play at only a small handful of operators they've approved.Delaware became the first state to legalize online  gambling, in June 2012, and the third to launch (Nov. 26, 2013).  ( USA  Today, Delaware  Online, Casino.org)The District of Colmbia became the first jurisdiction to  legalize online gambling in the U.S., in April 2011. However,  the measure was repealed in February 2012 before it ever became  active.  ( NY  Times)A Kentucky judge agreed to allow Kentucky seize 141  gambling-related domain names, since online gambling violates  Kentucky law. This was plainly absurdâby that logic any country  could seize any domain anywhere in the world if the website happened  to violate local law. The Kentucky Court of Appeals quickly  overturned the action, but then the State appealed, and now the  court is saying that the domain name owners have to come forward or  else risk losing the domains. However, if they appear in court  then U.S. authorities might arrest them for operating online  gaming sites.  ( EFF2008, KY  appealed in 2009, \"\"Must  appear\"\" ruling in 2010 )New Jersey became the third state to legalize  online gambling (poker + casino), signed into law in February 2013,  and launching on Nov. 25th.  ( NJ  Poker Online)Nevada became the first state to legalize gambling  (well, poker at least), on Feb. 21, 2013  ( CBS) and launching on April 30.  ( LVRJ)In North Dakota, Jeffrey Trauman paid a $500 fine on what  was probably over $100,000 in sports bet winnings.  ( Gambling  & the Law, 2003)Oklahoma doesn't specifically outlaw online gambling, but  their draconian statutes outlaw just about any kind of gambling  whatsoever, so when police officer Roland Benavides was caught  placing sports bets online in 2011, they charged under the general  anti-gambling statute. In 2012 he received a deffered sentence  (which means that if he doesn't violate the terms of his probation,  he will likely face no jail time).  ( News  OK)In Washington State, it's a felony to play poker  online, punishable by up to five years in prison and a $10,000  fine.  ( GPWA 2010, PokerListings 2008)Old Summary of State Laws. Chuck Humphrey has a summary  of state gambling laws, but as I write this in Nov. 2015, it  hasn't been updated since 2007.

      "174249-D2204701\tdoes xpress bet charge to deposit money in your account\thttp://www.oddsshark.com/real-money/paypal PayPal Betting Sites PayPal Betting SitesFacebook Twitter RedditPayPal was the original online payment service, and is still used by millions of people around the world. They can be used to deposit and withdraw from online betting sites in many regulated markets. At the moment, laws restricting financial transactions to betting sites from the US mean that this canât be used by Americans for gambling transactions. This article covers the pros and cons of PayPal, and shows you what to look out for at betting sites that accept this payment option.Best PayPal Betting SitesFirst of all, we have introduced PayPal, briefly covering their history and the benefits of choosing this system. After that, you will find some of the key factors to look out for when choosing a betting site for your PayPal deposits. Finally, we have summarized the alternative payment methods and compared each to using PayPal.Why Choose PayPal for your Betting Site Deposits?PayPal started back in 1999 and was a pioneer in providing an internet-based payment service. This system really took off in 2002, when it was acquired by eBay, becoming the payment method of choice for the majority of their users. Volume reached a staggering $71 billion by 2009, and this system now operates in every corner of the globe.The key advantages of PayPal for sports betting fans are that you can deposit and withdraw almost instantly. By holding your balance in a separate account, you create a buffer between your bank and internet betting sites. For many players, this adds extra security â since no gambling site operator needs to hold any of your bank account information.The disadvantage is that there are fees for receiving money though this system. These total a few percent of each transaction.PayPal Betting Sites â What to Look for Before you DepositFortunately, PayPal are selective when it comes to the gambling site operators that they allow to use their service. This means that seeing PayPal betting site deposits is a trust signal in its own right. Most of the operators accepting this deposit method are the big brands in the UK, Canada, or Europe who are fully licensed and often have parent companies listed on the London Stock Exchange.Even with this extra level of trust, we recommend you check for a license, responsible gaming policy, and external certification of game fairness. A reputation for good customer service, fair dispute resolution, and fast payouts to players are also vital when it comes to online betting sites. Spending just a few minutes online making sure there are no major issues can potentially save you a lot of trouble later down the line.Once legitimacy has been verified, the sports covered and financial incentives can be compared.Most PayPal betting sites are large, and so will cover a wide range of the popular sports. What you need to check for is the range of bets offered, and the value in the odds youâll receive. Outside of the major sports, you will find bigger differences between the betting sites. For example, all of the major operators will cover international events, though only a few will have a variety of bets on the minor in-country leagues of niche sports.Financial incentives take the form of bonuses, promotions, and free bets. Most PayPal betting sites will offer you a sign-up bonus, usually between 25% and 100% of your first deposit. The terms of these deals can differ considerably. These include how many times youâll need to bet the bonus amount, and restrictions on these bets (for example, odds greater than 2-to-1 only). Other welcome bonuses include free bets - or refunds on your initial bets if your team loses.Promotions and ongoing offers will be more important than the welcome deal in the long run. The best sites make a real effort to look after their loyal customers. You can check current (and often past) promotions before you sign up to make sure youâll be treated well.How do Other Betting Site Deposit Methods Compare to PayPal?PayPal is quick and easy when it comes to making betting site deposits, but this is not always the cheapest method. There are other online payment services which offer lower fees, especially when it comes to receiving money. Skrill (formerly Moneybookers) is a great example, and Neteller is another alternative. These methods are widely accepted, though are not as useful for everyday purchases and transactions, as fewer organizations or individuals use them.Credit cards and debit cards are the easiest betting site deposit methods of all. These do not incur any charges to the user, and your money is available instantly to bet. Many people are concerned about giving their card details to online betting sites. There are also legitimate reasons why some people prefer gambling transactions not appear on their bank statement.Bank wires are a great way of getting larger sums on to and off of betting sites. These can take up to three days, especially if done internationally. We recommend this method for withdrawing a big win, as it will not incur any PayPal fees.\t0\r\n",
      "174249-D1809352\tdoes xpress bet charge to deposit money in your account\thttp://classroom.synonym.com/pay-bills-echeck-24138.html How to Pay Bills by eCheck Home Â» TechnologyHow to Pay Bills by eCheckBy Louise Balle; Updated September 11, 2015Paper checks are as obsolete as payphones nowadays. You might have stacks of old paper checks still sitting in your office or desk drawer, unused after years. This is because there are so many more convenient ways to pay bills and other obligations now. With the advent of Internet bill processing and the Check 21 Act of 2004 that made it legal for banks to process checks electronically, individuals can now pay bills using eChecks. All that you need is basic information about your checking account to write one of these eChecks. The clearing process for eChecks is quick and this payment method helps save the planet by reducing the need for paper checks.Step 1Sign up with an online payment service like Paypal or Xpress Bill Pay (see links below under Resources). Paypal is one of the few services that allow individuals to send eChecks to each other---as long as both people have a Paypal account in good standing. You can also go directly to your billing company's website to see if they will allow you to process an eCheck on the site. Many electric and utilities companies, mortgage loan firms, and insurance businesses allow eChecks.Step 2Register your checking account. Enter your bank name, routing number and account number. You can find your bank routing number by either calling your bank directly or looking at your checkbook (the first nine digit number at the bottom).Step 3Enter the full address of your bank (and your own address if requested). In most cases, the address that is listed on your bank's website is acceptable.Step 4Once your checking account information is saved, click the option to send a new payment. Enter the full name and address of the payee and the amount that you would like to pay. In the case of PayPal, you will need to have the PayPal email address of the person you would like to pay.Step 5Submit your eCheck. eChecks commonly take three to five business days to clear your account and be deposited to the account of the payee (as long as the payee is registered with your chosen bill pay service). Other bill pay services will process your eCheck payment and create a physical check to be mailed to the payee after the payment clears your checking account.WarningDon't do an internet search for your routing number. You may come up with a routing number that is valid for your bank, but not for the bank branch where you opened your account. The wrong routing information will cause your eCheck request to be rejected.ResourcesPaypalXpress Bill PayAbout the AuthorLouise Balle has been writing Web articles since 2004, covering everything from business promotion to topics on beauty.
